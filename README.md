# DragonRuby TweetCarts
TweetCarts I made with DragonRuby

A TweetCart is a program, game or artwork that is written in 280 characters or less so that it can be posted on Twitter. TweetCarts should not use any external resources (such as image files) and should be entirely generated with code. TweetCarts originated with Pico-8 and are usually tweeted with the #tweetcart hashtag.

Because it's quite hard to compress useful or fun code into such a small space and the results are very hard to read, there is no real practical purpose for TweetCarts except to have fun and show off what you made.

My tweetcarts are made using DragonRuby Game Toolkit, which is amazing and I love it: http://dragonruby.herokuapp.com/toolkit/game

At the time of writing, a new module is being developed for DragonRuby with the goal of allowing extremely compact code. It's not yet final so it's not shipping with DragonRuby. I haven't published any tweets using the new module yet because that would break the rule about not including external resources. However, I may start posting them at some point to highlight what the new module can do. If this is the case I will mark the code as coming FROM THE FUTURE.
